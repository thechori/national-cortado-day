# ☕ National Cortado Day

## Hey there, fellow coffee enthusiast!

So I created this little corner of the internet because I'm _slightly_ obsessed with cortados, and I was shocked to discover there wasn't a proper celebration page for National Cortado Day (December 20th)! The injustice!

## What's this all about?

This is a fun, slightly quirky landing page dedicated to celebrating the humble cortado - that perfect marriage of espresso and just the right amount of steamed milk. Not too milky like a latte, not too intense like a straight espresso. As Goldilocks would say if she were a barista: "This one's juuuust right."

I built this using Next.js and Tailwind because, like a good cortado, I wanted something balanced - easy to modify but still looks fancy enough to impress your coffee snob friends.

## My Cortado Story

I discovered cortados after years of drowning my espresso in milk (sorry, Italy). A barista at my local shop basically staged an intervention and said "try this instead." One sip of that perfectly balanced coffee-to-milk ratio and I was converted. Now I'm on a mission to spread the cortado gospel.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (like pulling your first shot of the day)
2. Run `npm install` (grinding the beans)
3. Run `npm run dev` (steaming the milk)
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (enjoying your perfect cortado!)

## Make It Your Own

Feel free to customize this to your heart's content! Add your favorite local coffee shops, change up the colors, or add more coffee facts. The code is commented and organized so you can easily find what you need to modify.

## Deployment

This project is ready to deploy on Vercel with just a few clicks. Like a good cortado, it's simple but impressive.

## A Final Note

Remember, friends don't let friends drink bad coffee. Share this page, spread the cortado love, and I'll see you on December 20th with a tiny glass of perfectly balanced coffee in hand!

P.S. How do you know if someone's into specialty coffee? Don't worry, they'll tell you. (I just did.)
