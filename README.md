# â˜• National Cortado Day

## Origin Story

Many years ago, I was overwhelmed by the different food holidays. It felt like there was one for every kind of food.. There was National Pizza Day, National Donut Day, the list went on.

I wondered to myself, "who's making these things??"

Frustrated by this thought, I took to my domain registrar of choice to search for my own holiday.

As an avid coffee drinker, and former Starbucks barista, it was only right that it be something with espresso in it.

I started at the top:

nationalcoffeeday.com, taken (of course)

nationallatteeday.com, taken (not surprising)

nationalmochaday.com, taken (makes sense)

nationalflatwhiteday.com, taken (darn, I thought that might've worked)

But then, something amazing happened... I tried one of my favorite drinks of all time, the cortado.

nationalcortadoday.com, _available for $12.99/yr_

I claimed it without hesitation, in fear that someone would beat me to it. Soon after I stood up a simple website to commemorate the tasty drink.

But what day to choose? My birthday of course, December 20th.

For this to really work, I told myself that I had to get onto Wikipedia. So I found [the article for the different national food holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_food_days), updated it with my new holiday, and cited the website I spun up as proof to support the edit.

It worked. Now, people all around the world celebrate this holdiay on my December 20th. There are posts on Instagram, Tiktok, website articles, you name it.

And that my friends, is the story of how I created my very own national food holiday.
